Early diagnosis and support for children with autism is paramount, as this plays a pivotal role in helping them adapt to social settings, ultimately leading to improved long-term outcomes.
To address the diagnostic disparity caused by socioeconomic factors, we have developed an image-based model to identify autism in children with an emphasis on accessibility.
Our primary objective was to take steps in the direction of ensuring that all children have access to accurate autism diagnosis.

We developed a model to expedite this process of drug discovery. Using our model, a researcher could input the molecular structure of a drug candidate, and our model would return information about the candidate’s efficacy in specifically addressing aggression and self-injurious behaviors in individuals with autism.""")
